Please add your pseudocode to this file

function consecutiveSubstrings(string):
    result = empty array
    
    for i from 0 to length of string - 1:
        for j from i + 1 to length of string:
            substring = extract characters from index i to j
            add substring to result
    
    return result

And a written explanation of your solution

Solution Description:
This solution uses a nested loop approach to generate all consecutive substrings of an input string. 

Algorithm:
1. Create an empty result array to store all substrings
2. Use an outer loop to iterate through each index as a potential starting position
3. For each starting index i, use an inner loop to iterate through all possible ending indices j (from i+1 to string length)
4. For each (i, j) pair, extract the substring using string.slice(i, j) and add it to the result array
5. Return the result array containing all consecutive substrings in order

The nested loop structure ensures we generate all possible consecutive substrings:
- Substrings starting at index 0: 1 character, 2 characters, ..., all characters
- Substrings starting at index 1: 1 character, 2 characters, ..., remaining characters
- And so on for each starting position

Time Complexity: O(n²)

Explanation:
- Let n be the length of the input string
- The outer loop runs n times (once for each character)
- The inner loop runs (n - i) times for each iteration of the outer loop
- Total iterations = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 ≈ n²/2 = O(n²)
- Each string.slice() operation creates a new string of length (j-i)
- The total number of characters copied across all substrings is also O(n²)
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(n²) for storing all substrings in the result array
